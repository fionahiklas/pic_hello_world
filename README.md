# pic_hello_world
First simple pic microcontroller project

## Circuit

* Contains PIC 16F628A
* 5V supply (from bench PSU)
* Four LEDs (5mm)
 * Two orange (Vf = 1.6V)
 * Two Red (Vf = 1.7V)
 

### Resitor Calculation

Total V = 5V
Forward voltage = 1.6V
Resistor voltage drop = 3.4V
Forward current = 20mA

Resistor = 3.4/0.02
         = 6400

Using 10k resistors for ease
